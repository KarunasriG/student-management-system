# School Management System

A simple PHP-based web application to manage students and classes in a school.

---

## What I Have Done

1. **Student Management**:
   - Added functionality to **create**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** student records.
   - Students can be associated with a class, and their details (name, email, address, and image) are stored in the database.

2. **Class Management**:
   - Added functionality to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** classes.
   - Each class has a unique name and creation timestamp.

3. **Image Upload**:
   - Implemented image upload functionality for student profiles.
   - Images are stored in the `uploads/` directory and displayed on the student list.

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Used **MySQL** to store student and class data.
   - Implemented **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using PHP and PDO.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Designed a clean and responsive interface using **Bootstrap**.
   - Added modals for editing classes and students to improve user experience.
